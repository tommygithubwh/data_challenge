# Data challenge project

Research question:

How have prescriptions for epilepsy drugs varied over time, and by geographical region, in general practices in England?

a) How does the estimated prevalence of epilepsy in each general practice’s population correlate with prescribing patterns?

b) Are there any other characteristics of each general practice’s population that are associated with prescribing patterns? 

c) Have patterns in prescribing changed after: (1) the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, or (2) the NICE 2022 guideline for epilepsy?
