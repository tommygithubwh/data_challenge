# Essential Concepts
- When we speak of brain cells, we are usually always talking about neurons. However, neurons are not the only type of cell in the brain.
	- Neurons are the basic computational units of the brain. A wide variety of calculations can be achieved by chaining neurons together.
		- Neurons communicate with each other by means of substances called neurotransmitters.
			- Neurotransmitters affect how likely and at what rate a neuron will transmit its signal to other neurons.
			- Neurotransmitters require receptors to work. Changes in the structure of these receptors may affect how a neuron responds to neurotransmitters.
		- A signal within a single neuron may need to travel a considerable distance. To ensure signals can travel fast enough within neurons, they are sent through electrical impulses achieved by changing the voltage of the neuron's membrane. We refer to these electrical impulses as *action potentials*.
			- The change in voltage is created by opening or closing 'channels' that allow the passage of a specific type of ion.
				- The most common ions are calcium (Ca++), Sodium (Na+), Potassium (K+) and Chloride (Cl -).
		- Some drugs can modify the response of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, and we can exploit this to control the predisposition to seizures.
	- Glial cells are the other type of brain cells. They provide critical structural and functional support to neurons.
		- Recently, we have learnt that glial cells are far more important than what we originally thought.
		- New treatments may focus on glial cells rather than neurons.
		
- Epilepsy â‰  Seizure
	- A seizure refers to an abnormal focal or generalised neuronal discharge. It often, but not always, presents with physical manifestations.
		- About 8% of the population will experience a seizure in their lifetime.
	- Epilepsy is a *chronic* condition of various aetiologies characterised by a predisposition to recurrent seizures.

# Epidemiology
*  Epilepsy is common
	* It is estimated that 1% of the population is affected by epilepsy. 
* Epilepsy is associated with poor outcomes and decreased quality of life.
	* Epileptics have 2x to 4x the mortality rate when compared with non-epileptic controls.
* Pharmacological therapy is the most common therapeutical approach for epilepsy.
	* In up to 70% of patients, anticonvulsants (aka antiepileptics) are sufficient for seizure control.
	* However, if a single first-line anticonvulsant fails, all other agents will likely fail.
		* **N.B.** It would be interesting to explore if different drugs have different failure rates.

# Pathophysiology 
- There are several potential explanations for epilepsy, but in general, seizures are caused by an abnormal and excessive discharge of brain neurons with hypersynchrony (several neurons firing, or discharging, at the same time).
-  Depending on the patient, epilepsy could result from one or more of the following reasons:
	- Increased neuronal excitation or decreased inhibition.
		- In the brain, the neurotransmitter primarily associated with the excitation of neurons is Glutamate,
		- On the other hand, the neurotransmitter Gamma-AminoButyric Acid, most commonly referred to as GABA, is primarily associated with inhibition. 
		- An 'excited' neuron is more likely to fire action potentials to other neurons, while an inhibited neuron is less likely to do so.
	- 'Sick neuron'.
		- A neuron becomes hyperexcitable due to a lesion or abnormality and fires action potentials when it shouldn't.
	- Genetic abnormalities may lead to abnormal function of neuroreceptors or ion channels.
	- Glial cells are responsible for removing excess neurotransmitters and maintaining a careful ionic balance in the brain. Damage to glial cells (e.g. due to a stroke or an injury) that impairs these functions can predispose to epilepsy.
# Classification of Epileptic Seizures
- Simplified version from the one provided by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)

- Partial seizures
	- Also known as focal seizures
	- Involve only a (focal) part of the body, e.g. the arm.
	- Can be further sub-classified as: 
		- Simple, when there is no change in consciousness;
		- Complex, when there is a change in consciousness; 
		- Partial seizures evolving into secondarily generalised, when it starts on a focal part of the body before spreading to the entire body.
- Generalised seizures
	- These involve the entire body from the start, and there is always a change in consciousness.
	- Can be further sub-classified as:
		- Absence seizures (almost exclusive to children)
		- Atypical absence seizures
		- Myoclonic seizures
		- Clonic seizures
		- Tonic seizures
		-  Tonic-clonic seizures
		- Atonic seizures
		- Infantile spasms 

- Epilepsy can be considered idiopathic when the cause is likely to be genetic; Symptomatic when the cause of the epilepsy is a lesion, an infection or a metabolic abnormality; Cryptogenic are those epilepsies that are presumed to be symptomatic, but no specific cause can be found.	
# Pharmacology
- Three main modes of action (although some drugs have more than one).
	- **Voltage-dependent Na+ channel blockade**
		- Example: Phenytoin and Carbamazepine
		- Increases the time Na+ channels remain inactive, which prevents very rapid neuronal firing rates.
	- **Enhancement of GABA-A system**
		- Example: Barbiturates (enhance and directly activate GABA receptors), benzodiazepines (enhances the activity of GABA receptors but don't activate them), and Valproate/Valproic acid.
		- GABA increases the amount of excitation that a neuron requires to discharge, i.e., inhibits the neuron.
	- **Binding to T-type Ca++ channels**
		- Example: Ethosuximide
		- These drugs block a subtype of  Ca++ channels found in a specific part of the brain, the thalamus. This subtype of Ca++ channels is the one involved in absence seizures.
